## Background
This is a management system related to esports, the esports club management system.
Esports is a super fast growing industry in the past few years, and it's also a field I am passionate about. Each team is becoming more and more complete, from small temas to large teams with operational team support. And a management system can help them handle their club efficiently.

## Introduction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
It includes Ant Design components to construct interfaces. 
It uses a cloud database of MongoDB.
As for quick browsing, you can access the deployed site directly. [Royal Never Give Up](ec2-54-217-174-185.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:80).

## Install
Firstly, clone the repository from github.
The dependencies should all be included in `package.json` file, so just go [npm](https://npmjs.com) install if you don't have them locally installed. (Hint: `npm install` for both `react-client` and `react-server`.)
Then 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AnthemLights64/FYPproject.git
$ cd react-client
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ cd react-server
$ npm install
```
## Quick Start
Open two terminals, `react-client` and `react-server`. 
Go `npm start` at `react-server` firstly. (Don't close this terminal, keep it running.)
``` sh
npm start
```
And then go `npm start` at `react-client`.
``` sh
npm start
```
Now you can access localhost for this project.
``` sh
http://localhost:3000
```
***Important hint:*** After cloning the project to your own PC, remember to alter the url in FYPprject/react-client/src/utils/constants.js. 
Comment out the AWS server url, use localhost.
